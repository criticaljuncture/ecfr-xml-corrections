-</P>
-<P>(b) We will issue a public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to determine if there is competitive interest in using the proposed facility for alternate use activities. BOEM will specify a time period for members of the public to express competitive interest.
-</P>
-<P>(c) If we receive indications of competitive interest within the published timeframe, we will proceed with a competitive offering. As part of such competitive offering, each competing applicant must submit a description of the types of activities proposed for the existing facility, as well as satisfactory evidence that the competing applicant qualifies to hold a grant on the OCS, as required in §§ 586.107 and 586.108, by a date we specify.
