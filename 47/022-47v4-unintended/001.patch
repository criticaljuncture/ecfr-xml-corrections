 <P>(4) UHF DTV stations may request an increase in power, up to a maximum of 1000 kW ERP, to enhance service within their authorized service area.
 </P>
-<P>(5) Licensees and permittees assigned a DTV channel in the initial DTV Table of Allotments may request an increase in either ERP in some azimuthal direction or antenna HAAT, or both, that exceed the initial technical facilities specified for the allotment in Appendix B of the <I>Memorandum Opinion and Order</I> (referenced in paragraph (c) of this section), up to the maximum permissible limits on DTV power and antenna height set forth in paragraph (f)(6), (f)(7), or (f)(8) of this section, as appropriate, or up to that needed to provide the same geographic coverage area as the largest station within their market, whichever would allow the largest service area. Such requests must be accompanied by a technical showing that the increase complies with the technical criteria in § 73.623(c), and thereby will not result in new interference exceeding the <I>de minimis</I> standard set forth in that section, or statements agreeing to the change from any co-channel or adjacent channel stations that might be affected by potential new interference, in accordance with § 73.623(f). In the case where a DTV station has been granted authority to construct pursuant to § 73.623(c), and its authorized coverage area extends in any azimuthal direction beyond the DTV coverage area determined for the DTV allotment reference facilities, then the authorized DTV facilities are to be used in addition to the assumed facilities of the initial DTV allotment to determine protection from new DTV allotments pursuant to § 73.623(d) and from subsequent DTV applications filed pursuant to § 73.623(c). The provisions of this paragraph regarding increases in the ERP or antenna height of DTV stations on channels in the initial DTV Table of Allotments shall also apply in cases here the licensee or permittee seeks to change the station's channel as well as alter its ERP and antenna HAAT. Licensees and permittees are advised that where a channel change is requested, it may, in fact, be necessary in specific cases for the station to operate with reduced power, a lower antenna, or a directional antenna to avoid causing new interference to another station.

 <P>(6) A DTV station that operates on a channel 2–6 allotment created subsequent to the initial DTV Table will be allowed a maximum ERP of 10 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in Zone I or a maximum ERP of 45 kW if its antenna HAAT is at or below 305 meters and it is located in Zone II or Zone III. A DTV station that operates on a channel 2–6 allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments may request an increase in power and/or antenna HAAT up to these maximum levels, provided the increase also complies with the provisions of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
