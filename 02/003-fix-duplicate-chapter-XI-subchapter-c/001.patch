+<P>(a) This part specifies a standard format and standard wording of general terms and conditions for Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements, which concerns national policy requirements.
+</P>
+<P>(b) It thereby implements:
+</P>
+<P>(1) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR 200.210(b)(ii) and 200.300, as those paragraphs of 2 CFR part 200 relate to national policy requirements for general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

+<HEAD>§ 1122.2   Definition of “national policy requirement.”</HEAD>
+<P>For the purposes of this chapter, a national policy requirement is a requirement:
+</P>
+<P>(a) That is prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refers to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;
+</P>
+<P>(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

+<HEAD>§ 1122.3   Definition of other terms as they are used in this part.</HEAD>
+<P>Because the meaning of some terms used in this part derive from their definitions in the statutes, Executive orders, or other sources of national policy requirements that this part implements, the meanings of those terms may vary from their meanings in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations. For example, some statutes define “State<I>”</I> in ways that differ from each other and from the definition provided in 2 CFR part B. In each case, the definition in the source of the pertinent national policy requirement takes precedence over the definition in 2 CFR part B for the purposes of complying with that requirement.

+</P>
+<P>(2) A DoD Component in that case:

+<P>(i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.

-<P>(10) For a new award (or, as needed, in a modification that amends any of the following information):
-</P>
-<P>(i) Whether the project or program under the award is research and development (R&amp;D). This information is needed by auditors performing single audits of recipients because the OMB guidance to the auditors treats all Federal agencies' R&amp;D programs as a single group (or “cluster”) of programs for audit sampling purposes (see the Single Audit Act requirements implemented in subpart E of 2 CFR part 1128 and FMS Article V in appendix E to part 1128).

-<P>(A) Scope of work or other appropriate content to specify the goals and objectives of the project or program supported by the award;
-</P>
-<P>(B) Approved budget; and
-</P>
-<P>(C) General, and any award specific, terms and conditions of the award.
-</P>
-<P>(iii) Where the portions of the award listed in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section are located, which content the DoD Component generally should incorporate into the award by reference. When incorporating that content into the award by reference, the DoD Component must both:
-</P>
-<P>(A) Indicate in the award cover pages that the award incorporates those items into the award by reference, thereby making them an integral part of the award; and
-</P>
-<P>(B) Specify their location (see § 1120.315), rather than transmit them in their entirety with each award.
-</P>
-<P>(iv) The order of precedence in the event of conflict among the general and any award-specific terms and conditions and other potential sources of requirements (<I>e.g.,</I> Federal statutes).
-</P>
-<P>(v) The name of, and contact information for, the individual or office in the DoD responsible for post-award administration of the award. If there are multiple individuals and offices for different post-award functions (<I>e.g.,</I> payments and property administration), the award cover pages should provide information about each.
-</P>
-<P>(vi) The name of, and contact information for, the DoD Component's program manager or other point of contact for programmatic matters.
-</P>
-<P>(b) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the recipient entity:
-</P>
-<P>(1) The recipient's unique entity identifier required for its registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Currently, that is the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.
-</P>
-<P>(2) The recipient's business name and address, which must be the legal business or “doing business as” name and physical address in SAM at the time of award corresponding to the recipient's unique entity identifier.
-</P>
-<P>(3) The name and title of the recipient's authorized representative, either the individual who signed the application or proposal on behalf of the recipient entity or another individual designated by that entity.
-</P>
-<P>(4) The name of the recipient's Project or Program Director (PD) or Principal Investigator (PI) and his or her organization, if different from the name of the recipient organization. If there are multiple PDs or co-PIs, the name and organization of each should be included.
-</P>
-<P>(5) The indirect cost rate in effect at the start of the performance period for the award, which generally is a Governmentwide rate negotiated by the recipient's cognizant agency for indirect costs. However, this requirement does not apply - <I>i.e.,</I> the award cover pages need not include the recipient's indirect cost rate - if the recipient entity affirms that it treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information.
-</P>
-<P>(c) May also include, as applicable, elements such as:
-</P>
-<P>(1) A statement that the award can be amended only by a grants officer. The statement might also explain how amendments are issued.
-</P>
-<P>(2) Information about any planned, future incremental funding or options for which amounts were pre-determined.

-<P>(1) There is not currently any DoD form for the award cover pages; or
-</P>
-<P>(2) The DoD Component obtains approval for a deviation from the requirement to use a DoD form from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in accordance with the procedures specified in 32 CFR 21.340.

-<P>(a) This part specifies a standard format and standard wording of general terms and conditions for Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements, which concerns national policy requirements.
-</P>
-<P>(b) It thereby implements:
-</P>
-<P>(1) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR 200.210(b)(ii) and 200.300, as those paragraphs of 2 CFR part 200 relate to national policy requirements for general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.

-<HEAD>§ 1122.2   Definition of “national policy requirement.”</HEAD>
-<P>For the purposes of this chapter, a national policy requirement is a requirement:
-</P>
-<P>(a) That is prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refers to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;
-</P>
-<P>(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and

-<HEAD>§ 1122.3   Definition of other terms as they are used in this part.</HEAD>
-<P>Because the meaning of some terms used in this part derive from their definitions in the statutes, Executive orders, or other sources of national policy requirements that this part implements, the meanings of those terms may vary from their meanings in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations. For example, some statutes define “State<I>”</I> in ways that differ from each other and from the definition provided in 2 CFR part B. In each case, the definition in the source of the pertinent national policy requirement takes precedence over the definition in 2 CFR part B for the purposes of complying with that requirement.

-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Authority to use alternate wording.</I> (1) A DoD Component may use different wording for a national policy requirement than is provided in appendices A through D to this part if it is authorized or required to do so by a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.
-</P>
-<P>(2) A DoD Component in that case:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) May either reserve the paragraph of Section A of the article in which that national policy requirement otherwise would appear or insert in that paragraph wording to refer the recipient to the paragraph in Section B of the article in which the requirement does appear.

-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Individual exceptions.</I> The Head of the DoD Component or his or her designee may approve an individual exception affecting only one award in accordance with procedures stated in 32 CFR 21.340.

-<P>(3) <I>Small awards.</I> A DoD Component's terms and conditions for small awards may apply less restrictive requirements than those specified in this subchapter (a small award is an award for which the total value of obligated funding through the life of the award is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold).
-</P>
-<P>(4) <I>Other class exceptions.</I> The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering or his or her designee may approve any class exception affecting multiple awards other than small awards, with OMB concurrence if the class exception is for a requirement that is inconsistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200.

-<HEAD>§ 1128.210   Payment requirements for States.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>Policy.</I> Payments to States are subject to requirements in Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205 that implement the Cash Management Improvement Act. Those regulations are in two subparts with distinct requirements that apply to different programs:
-</P>
-<P>(1) Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 contains requirements for payments to States under “major programs,” as defined in that part. The Department of the Treasury negotiates Treasury-State agreements for major programs. Those agreements specify the appropriate timing and amounts of payments. They further specify a State's interest liability if it receives an advance payment too many days before it disburses the funds for program purposes, as well as the Federal Government's interest liability if it reimburses the State too many days after the State disburses the funds. Most DoD awards to States are not under major programs, so Subpart A applies relatively infrequently.
-</P>
-<P>(2) Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205 applies to all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements to States - <I>i.e.,</I> awards that are not under major programs.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>Award terms and conditions</I> - (1) <I>General.</I> Because few DoD awards to States are under major programs, appendix B to this part includes wording for Section A of FMS Article II that specifies the requirements of Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include this wording for Section A of FMS Article II if no award using those terms and conditions will be made to a State under a program designated as a major program in the applicable Treasury-State agreement.
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Exception for awards under major programs.</I> If a DoD Component is establishing general terms and conditions that will be used for awards to States, only some of which are subject to requirements for major programs in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, then the DoD Component should:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Use appendix B's wording for Section A of FMS Article II in its general terms and conditions; and
-</P>
-<P>(ii) In each award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make payments to the recipient subject to the requirements in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-State agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.

-<DIV8 N="§ 1128.215" TYPE="SECTION">
-<HEAD>§ 1128.215   Payment requirements for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>Policy.</I> OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for grants and cooperative agreements - advance payments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's general terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(1) <I>Advance payments.</I> With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in advance as long as the recipient maintains, or demonstrates the willingness to maintain, both:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes; and
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the wording of FMS Article I (see Subpart A and appendix A to this part).
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Reimbursement.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if the awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>Award terms and conditions</I> - (1) <I>General.</I> Appendix B provides wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a DoD Component:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request advance payments; and
-</P>
-<P>(ii) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those awards to request advance payments.
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Alternative award terms and conditions.</I> A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's wording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to specify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Would replace appendix B's wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement method of payment;
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Must include appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be renumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;
-</P>
-<P>(iii) Should omit appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply specifically to advance payments; and
-</P>
-<P>(iv) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably believed to be improper.

-<HEAD>§ 1128.220   Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>Policy.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that payments will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless a recipient is excepted in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 208 from the Governmentwide requirement to use EFT.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>Award terms and conditions</I> - (1) <I>Electronic funds transfer.</I> Appendix B provides wording for Section C of FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from the Governmentwide requirement.
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Other payment procedures or instructions.</I> A DoD Component may insert one or more paragraphs in its general terms and conditions in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 in appendix B, to provide procedural instructions or information regarding payments that is common to awards using those terms and conditions. For example, it may insert wording to give detailed instructions on where and how recipients are to submit payment requests. All forms, formats, and data elements for payment requests must be OMB-approved information collections.

-<P>(1) Charged to each cost-type:
-</P>
-<P>(i) DoD grant or cooperative agreement to a recipient of that entity type;

-<P>(i) Fixed-amount subaward, at any tier under a grant or cooperative agreement, to a subrecipient of that entity type; or

-<HEAD>§ 1128.415   Prior approvals for non-construction activities.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>OMB guidance.</I> OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a non-construction grant or cooperative agreement, which includes, for the purposes of this section, non-construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>DoD implementation of the guidance.</I> The following paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section provide details of the DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) and paragraph (h) specifies the corresponding award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (<I>i.e.,</I> prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Scope or objective, cost sharing or matching, and additional Federal funds.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must require that a recipient obtain DoD Component prior approval:
-</P>
-<P>(1) For a change in scope or objective of the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(i).
-</P>
-<P>(2) For any change in the cost sharing or matching included in the approved budget for which FMS Article VI requires prior approval, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vii).
-</P>
-<P>(3) If the need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(viii).
-</P>
-<P>(d) <I>Personnel changes, disengagements, or reductions in time.</I> A DoD Component must include the following prior approval requirements in general terms and conditions of research awards and may include them in general terms and conditions of other non-construction awards:
-</P>
-<P>(1) A change in a key person, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(ii).
-</P>
-<P>(2) A principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from, or reduction in time devoted to, the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iii).
-</P>
-<P>(e) <I>Costs requiring prior approval under the cost principles.</I> With respect to waivers of prior approvals required by the cost principles, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iv):
-</P>
-<P>(1) Any waiver of a cost principles requirement for prior approval by a recipient entity's cognizant agency for indirect costs is appropriately addressed in award-specific terms and conditions, rather than general terms and conditions, because the general terms and conditions must be appropriate for use in awards to multiple recipient entities.
-</P>
-<P>(2) A DoD Component may waive requirements in the cost principles for recipients to request prior approval before charging certain costs as direct costs to awards. However, the DoD Component should carefully consider each prior approval requirement individually and decide:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Which, if any, to waive; and
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Whether to make the waiver of the prior approval requirement contingent on specified conditions (<I>e.g.,</I> a DoD Component might waive the prior approval required for direct charging of special purpose equipment purchases under an award but elect to waive it only up to a certain dollar value).
-</P>
-<P>(f) <I>Transfers of funds and subawards.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include prior approval requirements for:
-</P>
-<P>(1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).
-</P>
-<P>(2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).
-</P>
-<P>(3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the general terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using those terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. As a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is not appropriate for the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements that support research.
-</P>
-<P>(g) <I>Pre-award costs, carry forward of unobligated balances, and no-cost extensions.</I> (1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to incur project costs up to 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance, at their own risk, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(1). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(4) makes that authorization the default policy for research awards. Therefore, a DoD Component must use this policy in general terms and conditions for research awards unless exceptional circumstances provide the basis for overriding that policy.
-</P>
-<P>(2) If a DoD Component's general terms and conditions are used for awards that have multiple periods of performance, the DoD Component should authorize recipients to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent periods of performance, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(3), unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.
-</P>
-<P>(3) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to initiate one-time extensions in the periods of performance of their awards by up to 12 months, subject to the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(2), but only if the DoD Component judges that authorizing no-cost extensions for awards using the general terms and conditions will not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply with DoD funding policies (<I>e.g.,</I> the incremental program budgeting and execution policy for research funding) contained in Volume 2A of the DoD Financial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14-R.
-</P>
-<P>(h) <I>Award terms and conditions.</I> Appendix D to this part provides wording for inclusion in Section B of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. Specifically:
-</P>
-<P>(1) In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.a and B.1.i of FMS Article IV and, if there will be cost sharing or matching required under any awards using the general terms and conditions, paragraph B.1.g.
-</P>
-<P>(2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for research awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component also may include paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c in general terms and conditions for other non-construction awards.
-</P>
-<P>(3) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraph B.1.d of FMS Article IV unless the DoD Component decides to waive any requirements in the applicable cost principles for recipients to obtain prior approval before including certain types of costs as direct charges to awards. If a DoD Component elects to waive any of those prior approval requirements, it must add wording to paragraph B.1.d to identify the specific types of costs for which recipients need not obtain DoD Component prior approval (thereby leaving in place the other prior approval requirements in the cost principles).
-</P>
-<P>(4) In accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.e, B.1.f, and B.1.h (except as noted for research awards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and Section C of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component may modify the wording as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section (<I>e.g.,</I> to limit the authorization for pre-award costs in non-construction awards other than research to a period of less than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance).
-</P>
-<P>(5) If no awards using a DoD Component's general terms and conditions will support non-construction activities, the DoD Component may reserve section B.1 of the wording that appendix D provides for FMS Article IV.

-<HEAD>§ 1128.630   Valuation of services or property contributed or donated by recipients or subrecipients.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>OMB guidance.</I> OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) specifies:
-</P>
-<P>(1) That values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200; and
-</P>
-<P>(2) Types of projects or programs under which recipients' or subrecipients' donations of buildings or land are allowable as cost sharing or matching, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, and how the donations are to be valued in those cases.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>DoD implementation.</I> DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications:
-</P>
-<P>(1) <I>Cost principles to be used for valuation.</I> (i) Values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Consistent with the cost principles, what generally should be charged to awards for real property and equipment is depreciation rather than allowing a recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property (<I>i.e.,</I> counting the full value of the property toward cost sharing or matching). However, depreciation included in a recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs is not appropriate for counting as cost sharing or matching under an individual award.
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Donations of property to projects or programs under awards.</I> (i) In addition to donations of buildings or land described in 2 CFR 200.306(d), recipients and subrecipients may, with the prior approval of the DoD Component, donate other capital assets described in the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3). The basis for clarifying that recipients may donate other capital assets to projects or programs under awards is that, with the DoD Component's approval:
-</P>
-<P>(A) Capital expenditures to acquire those types of capital assets are allowable as direct charges to awards; and
-</P>
-<P>(B) The costs therefore satisfy the allowability criterion in 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4) and can qualify as cost sharing or matching if they meet the other criteria listed in 2 CFR 200.306(b).
-</P>
-<P>(ii) However, when there are alternative ways for recipients to meet requirements for cost sharing or matching, DoD Components should not approve donations of capital assets to projects or programs under awards. Inclusion of the full value of a donated asset as project costs in the approved budget of an award is analogous to inclusion of the acquisition cost for an asset that is purchased under the award. Through the donation, the Federal Government acquires an interest in the donated asset that must be resolved at time of disposition of the asset, which is best avoided if possible.
-</P>
-<P>(iii) Whenever a DoD Component permits a recipient to donate a capital asset to a project or program under an award, the DoD Component should inform the cognizant Federal agency that negotiates the indirect cost rate for that recipient. Doing so enables the cognizant agency to take the donation into account when it establishes the recipient's indirect cost rate, given that the recipient may not include depreciation for the donated asset as indirect costs that enter into the computation of that rate.
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Award terms and conditions</I> - (1) <I>General.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section E of FMS Article VI.

-<P>(a) <I>Requirement.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the kinds of income included as program income, the way or ways in which a recipient may use it, the duration of the recipient's accountability for it, and related matters.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>Award terms and conditions.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VII the wording appendix G to this part provides, unless, as authorized by §§ 1128.710 through 1128.725, there are revisions to the wording of Sections A and E of the article or Section D is reserved.

-<HEAD>§ 1128.710   What program income includes.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>OMB guidance.</I> Under the definition of “program income” at 2 CFR 200.80 and related OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.307, an agency's regulations or terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements may include as program income:
-</P>
-<P>(1) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them; and
-</P>
-<P>(2) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>DoD implementation.</I> Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, each DoD Component must exclude the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Award terms and conditions</I>  -  (1) <I>General.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section A of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions. Doing so excludes the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Exceptions.</I> If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for including either or both types of income described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, it may do so by appropriately revising the wording appendix G provides for Section A of FMS Article VII. For example, to include as program income:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on them, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.c and insert the wording of that paragraph as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.d and insert that wording as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.

-<HEAD>§ 1128.715   Recipient obligations for license fees and royalties.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>Policy.</I> Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment provides otherwise, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may not specify that recipients have obligations to the Federal Government with respect to program income from license fees and royalties for patents or patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, or inventions produced under DoD awards.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>Award terms and conditions</I> - (1) <I>General.</I> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must implement the policy in paragraph (a) of this section by including the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section D of FMS Article VII.
-</P>

-<HEAD>§ 1128.720   Program income use.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>OMB guidance.</I> OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e) identifies alternative ways that a Federal agency might specify that recipients use program income they earn.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>DoD implementation.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how recipients are to use program income under awards using those terms and conditions.
-</P>
-<P>(1) The terms and conditions may specify one of the following ways for recipients to use program income:
-</P>
-<P>(i) <I>Addition.</I> A recipient under this alternative adds program income to the total amount of the approved budget, which consists of the Federal share of funding and any required matching or cost sharing.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) <I>Deduction.</I> A recipient using this alternative subtracts program income from total allowable costs to determine net allowable costs for purposes of determining the Federal share of funding and any required cost sharing or matching.
-</P>
-<P>(iii) <I>Cost sharing or matching.</I> Under this alternative, a recipient counts program income toward its required cost sharing or matching.
-</P>
-<P>(iv) <I>Combination.</I> The fourth alternative is a combination of any of the three alternatives described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For example, an agency might specify one alternative to be used for program income up to a dollar limit and a second alternative for any program income beyond that amount.
-</P>
-<P>(2) For research awards, absent compelling reasons to do otherwise for a specific set of general terms and conditions, a DoD Component must specify the addition alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(3) For general terms and conditions of other awards, a Component may specify any of the alternatives described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, the cost sharing or matching alternative is best used as part of a combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, unless the DoD Component knows at the time awards are made how much program income recipients will earn in relation to the amounts of their required cost sharing or matching.
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Award terms and conditions.</I> (1) <I>Default - addition alternative.</I> In accordance with the DoD implementation in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section E of FMS Article VII in:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Research awards; and
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Other awards for which it elects to specify the addition alternative for use of program income.
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Deduction alternative.</I> A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program income must modify the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Substituting the following wording for the wording of paragraph E.1: “1. You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved budget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4, such as the following, to inform recipients how the award will change if program income is deducted: “If you report program income on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), we will recalculate the Federal share of the budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share or shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the originally approved and recalculated budget amounts.”
-</P>
-<P>(3) <I>Cost-sharing or matching alternative.</I> A DoD Component electing to specify the cost-sharing or matching alternative for use of program income must replace the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E with the following wording: “You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award to meet any cost-sharing or matching requirement under this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”
-</P>
-<P>(4) <I>A combination of alternatives.</I> A DoD Component electing to specify some combination of addition, deduction, and cost-sharing or matching alternatives must use wording in Section E of FMS Article VII that specifies requirements for each alternative in the combination that is consistent with the requirements specified for that alternative in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.

-<DIV8 N="§ 1128.725" TYPE="SECTION">
-<HEAD>§ 1128.725   Program income after the period of performance.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>OMB guidance.</I> OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(f) provides that an agency may specify in agency regulations, grant or cooperative agreement terms and conditions, or agreements negotiated with recipients during the closeout process that a recipient is accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>DoD implementation.</I> A DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Award terms and conditions.</I> A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as Section F of FMS Article VII the wording for that section that is provided in appendix G to this part. That wording specifies that recipients are not accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the performance period. If an exception is warranted for an individual award, the exception is properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

-</HEAD>
-<P>Unless a DoD Component adds, deletes, or modifies wording, as permitted by §§ 1128.210 through 1128.220, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article II.
-</P>
-<HD1>FMS Article II. Payments. (DECEMBER 2014)
-</HD1>
-<P><I>Section A. Awards to States.</I> If the award-specific terms and conditions of this award do not identify it as an award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 (Department of the Treasury regulations implementing the Cash Management Improvement Act), then this award is subject to Subpart B of that part. Consistent with Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205:
-</P>
-<P>1. <I>Payment method, timing, and amounts. You must:</I>
-</P>
-<P>a. Minimize the time between your receipt of a payment under this award and your disbursement of those funds for program purposes.
-</P>
-<P>b. Limit the amount of each advance payment request to the minimum amount you need to meet your actual, immediate cash requirements for carrying out the program or project.
-</P>
-<P>c. Submit each advance payment request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for program purposes, so that your receipt of the funds will be as close in time as is administratively feasible to your actual cash outlay for direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
-</P>
-<P>2. <I>Interest.</I> Unlike awards subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, neither you nor we will incur any interest liability due to a difference in timing between your receipt of payments under this award and your disbursement of those funds for project or program purposes.
-</P>
-<P><I>Section B. Awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.</I>
-</P>
-<P>1. <I>Payment method.</I> Unless the award-specific terms and conditions of this award provide otherwise, you are authorized to request advance payments under this award. That authorization is contingent on your continuing to maintain, or demonstrating the willingness to maintain, written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between your receipt of each payment and your disbursement of the funds for program purposes. Note that you are not required to request advance payments and may instead, at your option, request reimbursements of funds after you disburse them for project or program purposes.
-</P>
-<P>2. <I>Amounts requested.</I> You must:
-</P>
-<P>a. Limit the amount of any advance payment request to the minimum amount needed to meet your actual, immediate cash requirements for carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project, including direct project costs and a proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
-</P>
-<P>b. Exclude from any payment request amounts you are withholding from payments to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of the work. You may request those amounts when you make the payments to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to ensure satisfactory completion of the work.
-</P>
-<P>c. Exclude from any payment request amounts from any of the following sources that are available to you for program purposes under this award: program income, including repayments to a revolving fund; rebates; refunds; contract settlements; audit recoveries; and interest earned on any of those funds. You must disburse those funds for program purposes before requesting additional funds from us.
-</P>
-<P>3. <I>Timing of requests.</I> For any advance payment you request, you should submit the request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for project or program purposes. With time for agency processing of the request, that should result in payment as close as is administratively feasible to your actual disbursements for project or program purposes.
-</P>
-<P>4. <I>Frequency of requests.</I> You may request payments as often as you wish unless you have been granted a waiver from requirements to receive payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT). If you have been granted a waiver from EFT requirements, the award-specific terms and conditions of this award specify the frequency with which you may submit payment requests.
-</P>
-<P>5. <I>Withholding of payments.</I> We will withhold payments for allowable costs under the award at any time during the period of performance only if one or more of the following applies:
-</P>
-<P>a. We suspend either payments or the award, or disallow otherwise allowable costs, as a remedy under OAR Article III due to your material failure to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of this award. If we suspend payments and not the award, we will release withheld payments upon your subsequent compliance. If we suspend the award, then amounts of payments are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of OAR Article III.
-</P>
-<P>b. You are delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,” in which case we may, after reasonable notice, inform you that we will not make any further payments for costs you incurred after a specified date until you correct the conditions or liquidate the indebtedness to the Federal Government.
-</P>
-<P>c. The award-specific terms and conditions of this award include additional requirements that provide for withholding of payments based on conditions identified during our pre-award risk evaluation, in which case you should have been notified about the nature of those conditions and the actions needed to remove the additional requirements.
-</P>
-<P>6. <I>Depository requirements.</I>
-</P>
-<P>a. There are no eligibility requirements for depositories you use for funds you receive under this award.
-</P>
-<P>b. You are not required to deposit funds you receive under this award in a depository account separate from accounts in which you deposit other funds. However, FMS Article I requires that you be able to account for the receipt, obligation, and expenditure of all funds under this award.
-</P>
-<P>c. You must deposit any advance payments of funds you receive under this award in insured accounts whenever possible and, unless any of the following apply, you must deposit them in interest-bearing accounts:
-</P>
-<P>i. You receive a total of less than $120,000 per year under Federal grants and cooperative agreements.
-</P>
-<P>ii. You would not expect the best reasonably available interest-bearing account to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on your cash balances of advance payments under Federal grants and cooperative agreements.
-</P>
-<P>iii. The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would require you to maintain an average or minimum balance higher than it would be feasible for you to do within your expected Federal and non-Federal cash balances.
-</P>
-<P>iv. A foreign government or banking system precludes your use of interest-bearing accounts.
-</P>
-<P>d. You may retain for administrative expenses up to $500 per year of interest that you earn in the aggregate on advance payments you receive under this award and other Federal grants and cooperative agreements. You must remit annually the rest of the interest to the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, using the procedures set forth in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(9).
-</P>
-<P><I>Section C. Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.</I>
-</P>
-<P>1. <I>Electronic funds transfer.</I> Unless the award-specific terms and conditions of this award provide otherwise, you will receive payments under this award by electronic funds transfer.

-</P>
-<HD1>FMS Article III. Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit (December 2014)
-</HD1>
-<P><I>Section A. Allowable costs.</I> This section, with the clarification provided in Section B, specifies which Federal cost principles must be used in determining the allowability of costs charged to this award, a subrecipient's costs charged to any cost-type subaward that you make under this award, and a contractor's costs charged to any cost-type procurement transaction into which you enter under this award. These cost principles also govern the allowable costs that you or a subrecipient of a subaward at any tier below this award may consider when establishing the amount of any fixed-amount subaward or fixed-price procurement transaction at the next lower tier. The set of cost principles to be used in each case depends on the type of entity incurring the cost under the award, subaward, or contract.
-</P>
-<P>1. <I>General case.</I> If you, your subrecipient, or your contractor is:
-</P>
-<P>a. <I>An institution of higher education</I>, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendix III to that part.
-</P>
-<P>b. <I>A hospital</I>, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of appendix IX to 2 CFR part 200, which currently specifies the cost principles in appendix IX to 45 CFR part 75 as the applicable cost principles.
-</P>
-<P>c. <I>A nonprofit organization other than a hospital or institution of higher education</I>, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices IV and VIII to that part. In accordance with guidance in 2 CFR 200.401(c), a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200 is subject to the cost principles for for-profit entities specified in paragraph 1.e of this section.
-</P>
-<P>d. <I>A State, local government, or Indian tribe</I>, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with applicable provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices V through VII to that part.
-</P>
-<P>e. <I>A for-profit entity (other than a hospital) or a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200:</I>
-</P>
-<P>i. The allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with:
-</P>
-<P>(A) The cost principles for commercial organizations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at Subpart 31.2 of 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) at Subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231; and
-</P>
-<P>(B) For a for-profit entity, the additional provisions on allowability of audit costs, in 32 CFR 34.16(f).
-</P>
-<P>ii. The indirect cost rate to use in that determination is:
-</P>
-<P>(A) The for-profit entity's federally negotiated indirect cost rate if it has one.
-</P>
-<P>(B) Subject to negotiation between you and the for-profit entity if it does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate. The rate that you negotiate may provide for reimbursement only of costs that are allowable in accordance with the cost principles specified in paragraph A.1.e.i of this article.
-</P>
-<P>2. <I>Exception.</I> You may use your own cost principles in determining the allowability of a contractor's costs charged to a cost-type procurement transaction under this award - or in pricing for a fixed-price contract based on estimated costs - as long as your cost principles comply with the Federal cost principles that paragraph A.1 of this section identifies as applicable to the contractor.
-</P>
-<P><I>Section B. Clarifications concerning charges for professional journal publications.</I> For an entity that Section A of this article makes subject to the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200:
-</P>
-<P>1. Costs of publishing in professional journals are allowable under 2 CFR 200.461(b) only if they are consistently applied across the organization. An organization may not charge costs of journal publications as direct costs to this award if it charges any of the same type of costs for other journal publications as indirect costs.
-</P>
-<P>2. “Costs of publication or sharing of research results” in 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3) are the “charges for professional journal publications” described in 2 CFR 200.461(b) and subject to the conditions of 2 CFR 200.461(b)(1) and (2).
-</P>
-<P><I>Section C. Period of availability of funds.</I> You may charge to this award only:
-</P>
-<P>1. Allowable costs incurred during the period of performance specified in this award, including any subsequent amendments to it;
-</P>
-<P>2. Any pre-award costs that you are authorized (by either the terms and conditions of FMS Article IV or the DoD awarding official) to incur prior to the start of the period of performance, at your own risk, for purposes of the project or program under this award; and
-</P>
-<P>3. Costs of publishing in professional journals incurred after the period of performance, as permitted under 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3), if:
-</P>
-<P>a. We receive the request for payment for such costs no later than the date on which REP Article II requires you to submit the final financial report to us (or, if we grant your request for an extension of the due date, that later date on which the report is due); and
-</P>
-<P>b. Your reported expenditures on the final financial report include the amount you disbursed for those costs.
-</P>
-<P><I>Section D. Fee or profit.</I>
-</P>
-<P>1. You may not receive any fee or profit under this award.
-</P>
-<P>2. You may not use funds available to you under this award to pay fee or profit to an entity of any type to which you make a subaward.
-</P>
-<P>3. You may pay fee or profit to an entity with which you enter into a procurement transaction to purchase goods or general support services for your use in carrying out the project or program under the award.

-<P>Unless a DoD Component reserves FMS Article VI in its entirety, reserves one or more paragraphs within sections of the article, or includes added or alternate wording, as permitted by §§ 1128.610 through 1128.635, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for FMS Article VI.
-</P>
-<HD1>FMS Article VI. Cost Sharing or Matching (DECEMBER 2014)
-</HD1>
-<P><I>Section A. Required cost sharing or matching</I>.
-</P>
-<P>1. If any cost sharing or matching is required under this award, the total amount or percentage required is shown in the award cover pages and included in the approved budget. That cost sharing or matching includes all:
-</P>
-<P>a. Cash contributions to the project or program either made by or through (if made by a third party) you and any subrecipients.
-</P>
-<P>b. Third-party in-kind contributions to the project or program.
-</P>
-<P>2. You must obtain our prior approval if you wish to:
-</P>
-<P>a. Change the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under this award.
-</P>
-<P>b. [Reserved].
-</P>
-<P><I>Section B. Allowability as cost sharing or matching.</I> Each cash or third party in-kind contribution toward any cost sharing or matching required under this award, whether put forward by you or a subrecipient under a subaward that you make, is allowable as cost sharing or matching if:
-</P>
-<P>1. You (or the subrecipient, if it is a subrecipient contribution) maintain records from which one may verify that the contribution was made to the project or program and, if it is a third-party in-kind contribution, its value.
-</P>
-<P>2. The contribution is not counted as cost sharing or matching for any other Federal award.
-</P>
-<P>3. The contribution is:
-</P>
-<P>a. Allowable under the cost principles applicable to you (or the subrecipient, if it is a subrecipient contribution) under FMS Article III of these terms and conditions; and
-</P>
-<P>b. Allocable to the project or program and reasonable.
-</P>
-<P>4. The Government does not pay for the contribution through another Federal award, unless that award is under a program that has a Federal statute authorizing application of that program's Federal funds to other Federal programs' cost sharing or matching requirements.
-</P>
-<P>5. The value of the contribution is not reimbursed by the Federal share of this award as either a direct or indirect cost.
-</P>
-<P>6. The contribution conforms to the other terms and conditions of this award, including the award-specific terms and conditions.
-</P>
-<P><I>Section C. Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching.</I> You may use your own or a subrecipient's unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching under this award. Unrecovered indirect costs means the difference between the amount of indirect costs charged to the award and the amount that you and any subrecipients could have charged in accordance with your respective approved indirect cost rates, whether those rates are negotiated or de minimis (as described in 2 CFR 200.414(f)).
-</P>
-<P><I>Section D. Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching.</I> If FMS Article VII of these general terms and conditions or the award-specific terms and conditions of this award specify that you are to use some or all of the program income you earn to meet cost-sharing or matching requirements under the award, then program income is allowable as cost sharing or matching to the extent specified in those award terms and conditions.
-</P>
-<P><I>Section E. Valuation of services or property that you or subrecipients contribute or donate.</I> You must establish values for services or property contributed or donated toward cost sharing or matching by you or subrecipients in accordance with the provisions of this section. These contributions or donations are distinct from third-party in-kind contributions to you or subrecipients, which are addressed in Section F of this article.
-</P>
-<P>1. <I>Usual valuation of services or property that you or subrecipients contribute or donate.</I> Values established for contributions of services or property by you or a subrecipient must be the amounts allowable in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution (<I>i.e.,</I> you or the subrecipient), as identified in FMS Article III. For property, that generally is depreciation.
-</P>
-<P>2. <I>Needed approvals for, and valuation of, property that you or subrecipients donate.</I>
-</P>
-<P>a. <I>Types of property that may be donated.</I>
-</P>
-<P>i. <I>Buildings or land.</I> If the purposes of this award include construction, facilities acquisition, or long-term use of real property, you may donate buildings or land to the project if you obtain our prior approval. Donation of property to the project, as described in PROP Article I, means counting the value of the property toward cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.
-</P>
-<P>ii. <I>Other capital assets.</I> If you obtain our prior approval, you may donate to the project other capital assets identified in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3).
-</P>
-<P>b. <I>Usual valuation of donated property.</I> Unless you obtain our approval as described in paragraph E.2.c of this article, the value for the donated property must be the lesser of:
-</P>
-<P>i. The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records at the time of donation, or
-</P>
-<P>ii. The current fair market value.
-</P>
-<P>c. <I>Approval needed for alternative valuation of property.</I> If you obtained our approval in the approved budget, you may count as cost sharing or matching the current fair market value of the donated property even if it exceeds the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records at the time of donation.
-</P>
-<P>d. <I>Federal interest in donated property.</I> Donating buildings, land, or other property to the project, rather than charging depreciation, results in a Federal interest in the property in accordance with PROP Article I of these terms and conditions.
-</P>
-<P><I>Section F. Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.</I>
-</P>
-<P>1. <I>General.</I> If a third party furnishes goods or services to you or subrecipients that are to be counted toward cost sharing or matching under this award, the entity to which the third party furnishes the goods or services (<I>i.e.,</I> you or a subrecipient) must document the fair market value of those in-kind contributions and, to the extent feasible, support those values using the same methods the entity uses internally.
-</P>
-<P>2. <I>Valuation of third-party services.</I> You must establish values for third-party volunteer services and services of third parties' employees furnished to you or subrecipients as follows:
-</P>
-<P>a. <I>Volunteer services.</I> Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor must be valued in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(e).
-</P>
-<P>b. <I>Services of third parties' employees.</I> When a third-party organization furnishes the services of its employees to you or a subrecipient, values for the contributions must be established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(f).
-</P>
-<P>c. <I>Additional requirement for donations to nonprofit organizations.</I> For volunteer services or services of third parties' employees furnished to a nonprofit organization:
-</P>
-<P>i. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.434(e) also applies and may require the nonprofit organization to allocate a proportionate share of its applicable indirect costs to the donated services.
-</P>
-<P>ii. The indirect costs that the nonprofit organization allocates to the donated services in that case must be considered project costs and may be either reimbursed under the award or counted toward required cost sharing or matching, but not both.
-</P>
-<P>3. <I>Valuation of third-party property.</I> You must establish values for third-party property furnished to you or subrecipients as follows:
-</P>
-<P>a. <I>Supplies donated by third parties.</I> When a third-party organization donates supplies (<I>e.g.,</I> office, laboratory, workshop, or classroom supplies), the value that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed the fair market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
-</P>
-<P>b. <I>Equipment, buildings, or land donated by third parties.</I>
-</P>
-<P>i. The value of third-party donations of equipment, buildings, or land that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching when the third party transferred title to you or a subrecipient depends on the purpose of the award in accordance with the following:
-</P>
-<P>(A) If one of the purposes of the award is to assist you or the subrecipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings, or land, you may count the aggregate fair market value of the donated property toward cost sharing or matching.
-</P>
-<P>(B) If the award's purposes instead include only the support of activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, you may only charge depreciation unless you obtain our prior approval to count as cost sharing or matching the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land.
-</P>
-<P>ii. The values of the donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the entity to which the third party transferred title to the property, with the qualifications specified in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(1) and (2) for donated land and buildings and donated equipment, respectively.
-</P>
-<P>c. <I>Use of space donated by third parties.</I> If a third party makes space available for use by you or a subrecipient, the value that you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal, as described in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(3).
-</P>
-<P>d. <I>Equipment loaned by third parties.</I> If a third party loans equipment for use by you or a subrecipient, the value that you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed its fair rental value.
