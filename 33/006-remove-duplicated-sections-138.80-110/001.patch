-<HEAD>§ 138.80   Applying for COFRs.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) <I>How to apply for a COFR.</I> To apply for a COFR of any type, the COFR Operator must - 
-</P>
-<P>(1) Submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Director, by one of the submission methods provided in § 138.60(c):
-</P>
-<P>(i) An Application;
-</P>
-<P>(A) For an Individual Certificate, list the name of the covered vessel, and the vessel's gross tonnage information, including the measurement system(s) used on the application;
-</P>
-<P>(B) For a Fleet Certificate, instead of listing each individual barge, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Fleet Certificate. The largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT GROSS TONNAGE] GRT”; and
-</P>
-<P>(C) For a Master Certificate, instead of listing each individual vessel, mark the box with the following statement: “This is an Application for a Master Certificate. The largest tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable. The largest vessel other than a tank vessel to be covered by this Application is [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GT ITC and [INSERT APPLICABLE GROSS TONS] GRT, as applicable.”
-</P>
-<P>(ii) The evidence of financial responsibility using one of the guaranty methods provided in § 138.110;
-</P>
-<P>(A) For a Fleet Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount, determined as provided in § 138.100, for the largest unmanned, non-self-propelled, non-tank barge to be covered.
-</P>
-<P>(B) For a Master Certificate, the evidence of financial responsibility must be in the total applicable amount determined as provided in § 138.100 for the largest tank vessel and largest non-tank vessel to be covered by the Master Certificate.
-</P>
-<P>(iii) The agent for service of process designations required by § 138.130; and
-</P>
-<P>(iv) All other supporting documentation required by this subpart.
-</P>
-<P>(A) At the time of Application for a Master Certificate, the COFR Operator must submit a report to the Director, indicating: the name; previous name, if applicable; type; gross tonnage and measurement system(s) used, for each vessel covered by the Master Certificate, indicating which vessels, if any, are tank vessels. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT tonnage, specify both gross tonnages.
-</P>
-<P>(B) Six months after receiving a Master Certificate, and every 6 months thereafter, each COFR Operator must submit to the Director, an updated report, separately listing the vessels no longer covered by that Master Certificate. If a vessel has both a GT ITC and GRT, both gross tonnages must be specified. If a vessel has been transferred to another responsible party and the COFR Operator to whom the Master Certificate was issued ceases to be the vessel's operator, the COFR Operator must report the date and place of the transfer, and the name and contact information of the responsible party to whom the vessel was transferred. If the vessels covered by the Master Certificate have not changed from the previous report, the COFR Operator may submit an updated report that indicates no change from previous report.
-</P>
-<P>(2) Pay, or cause to be paid, all fees required by § 138.120.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>Application deadline.</I> The Director must receive the Application, evidence of financial responsibility, and other required supporting documentation, at least 21 days prior to the date the Certificate is required. The COFR Operator may seek an exception to the 21-day submission deadline only as provided in § 138.60(e)(3).
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Where to obtain Application forms.</I> COFR Operators may create an Application using the online eCOFR web process (located at <I>https://npfc.uscg.mil/cofr/default.aspx</I>) or, if not using eCOFR, may obtain an “Application for Vessel Certificate of Financial Responsibility (Water Pollution)” at the same website.
-</P>
-<P>(d) <I>Requirement to verify, or sign and date, the Application.</I> (1) The COFR Operator must complete and either verify the Application in eCOFR as provided in § 138.60(c)(1)(i) or, if not using eCOFR, sign and date the hard-copy signature page of the Application and submit the signed Application to the Director, by one of the methods specified in § 138.60(c)(1)(ii) through (iv).
-</P>
-<P>(2) The Application must include the title of the person signing it.
-</P>
-<P>(3) If the person signing the Application is acting under a Power of Attorney, they must include a copy of the Power of Attorney with the Application.
-</P>
-<P>(e) <I>Requirement to update Applications.</I> The COFR Operator must report any changes to the Application to the Director in writing, no later than 5 business days after discovery of the change. The Director may require that the COFR Operator submit a revised Application and provide additional evidence of financial responsibility, and pay any additional fees required by § 138.120.
-</P>
-<P>(f) <I>Amending Fleet and Master Certificates.</I> Before operating a barge or vessel that exceeds the maximum gross tonnage indicated on the COFR, the COFR Operator must:

-</P>
-<P>(3) Pay a new certification fee, as required by § 138.120.

-<HEAD>§ 138.90   Renewing COFRs.</HEAD>
-<P>(a) The COFR Operator must submit a request for COFR renewal to the NPFC at least 21 days, but no earlier than 90 days, before the expiration date of the current COFR.
-</P>
-<P>(b) The COFR Operator may seek an exception to the 21-day request for COFR renewal submission deadline in paragraph (a) of this section only as provided in § 138.60(e)(3).

-<HEAD>§ 138.100   How to calculate a total applicable amount.</HEAD>
-<P>The total applicable amount is the sum of the OPA 90 applicable amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section plus the CERCLA applicable amount determined under paragraph (b) of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(a) <I>OPA 90 applicable amount.</I> The applicable amount under OPA 90 is equal to the applicable limit of liability determined as provided in subpart B of this part.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>CERCLA applicable amount.</I> The applicable amount under CERCLA is determined as follows:
-</P>
-<P>(1) For a vessel over 300 gross tons carrying a hazardous substance as cargo, and for any vessel covered under § 138.110(c)(3) or (d)(2)(ii) (calculation of CERCLA applicable amounts for financial guarantors and self-insurers), the greater of $5,000,000 or $300 per gross ton.
-</P>
-<P>(2) For any other vessel over 300 gross tons, the greater of $500,000 or $300 per gross ton.
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Amended applicable amounts.</I> If an applicable amount determined under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is amended by statute or regulation, the COFR Operator must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in an amount equal to or greater than the amended total applicable amount, as provided in § 138.240(a).
-</P>
-<P>(d) <I>OPA 90 and CERCLA applicable amounts and limits of liability.</I> The responsible parties are strictly, jointly and severally liable, for the costs and damages resulting from an incident or a release, but together they need only establish and maintain an amount of financial responsibility equal to the single limit of liability per incident or release. Only that portion of the evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart with respect to - 
-</P>
-<P>(1) OPA 90 is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to an incident where there is not also a release; and
-</P>
-<P>(2) CERCLA is required to be made available by a guarantor for the costs and damages related to a release where there is not also an incident. A guarantor (or a self-insurer for whom the exceptions to a limitations of liability are not applicable), therefore, is not required to apply the entire amount of financial responsibility to an incident involving oil alone or a release involving a hazardous substance alone.

-<P>(3) Termination provisions:
-</P>
-<P>(i) The guarantor must specify the reason for terminating the guaranty in the notice required by this paragraph, if known.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Termination of the guaranty as to any covered vessel will not affect the liability of the guarantor in connection with an incident or release commencing or occurring prior to the effective date of the guaranty termination.
-</P>
-<P>(4) If, at any time, the information contained in the evidence of financial responsibility submitted under this section changes, or there is a material change in a guarantor or self-insurer's financial position, the guarantor or COFR Operator or self-insurer (as applicable), must report the change to the Director, as provided in § 138.150.
-</P>
-<P>(b) <I>Insurance guaranty method.</I> The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the insurance guaranty method by submitting an Insurance Guaranty Form to the Director.
-</P>
-<P>(1) Each form must be executed by no more than four COFR insurance guarantors accepted by the Director. A lead underwriter is considered one of the COFR insurance guarantors.
-</P>
-<P>(2) The process for establishing and maintaining the acceptability of a COFR insurance guarantor is as follows:
-</P>
-<P>(i) The COFR insurance guarantor must request an initial determination by the Director of the COFR insurance guarantor's acceptability to serve as a COFR insurance guarantor under this subpart, at least 90 days before the date a COFR is required, by submitting information describing the COFR insurance guarantor's structure, business practices, history, and financial strength, and such other information as may be requested by the Director.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) The Director reviews the continued acceptability of COFR insurance guarantors annually. Each COFR insurance guarantor must submit updates to the initial request submitted under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, annually, within 90 days after the close of the COFR insurance guarantor's fiscal year, describing any material changes to the COFR insurance guarantor's legal status, structure, business practices, history, and financial strength, since the previous year's submission, and providing such other information as may be requested by the Director.
-</P>
-<P>(c) <I>Financial guaranty method.</I> The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the financial guaranty method by submitting a Financial Guaranty Form to the Director.
-</P>
-<P>(1) Each form must be executed by no more than four financial guarantors accepted by the Director, at least one of which must be a parent or affiliate of the COFR Operator. (<I>See</I> paragraph (g) of this section for additional requirements if more than one financial guarantor signs the form.)
-</P>
-<P>(2) The process for establishing and maintaining the acceptability of a financial guarantor is as follows:
-</P>
-<P>(i) The financial guarantor must comply with the self-insurance provisions in paragraph (d) of this section, and the periodic reporting requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) The financial guarantor must also demonstrate that it maintains net worth and working capital, each in amounts equal to or greater than - 
-</P>
-<P>(A) The aggregate total applicable amounts, calculated for each COFR Operator vessel for which the financial guaranty is being provided, based on each such COFR Operator's vessel with the greatest total applicable amount, plus - 
-</P>
-<P>(B) The total applicable amount required to be demonstrated by a self-insurer under this subpart if the financial guarantor is also acting as a self-insurer.
-</P>
-<P>(3) In the case of a vessel greater than 300 gross tons, calculate the CERCLA applicable amount under § 138.100(b)(1) based on a vessel carrying hazardous substances as cargo.
-</P>
-<P>(d) <I>Self-insurance method.</I> The COFR Operator may establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility using the self-insurance method as follows:
-</P>
-<P>(1) Submit to the Director the financial statements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section for the fiscal year preceding the date the COFR Operator signs the Application or request for COFR renewal.
-</P>
-<P>(2) Demonstrate that the COFR Operator maintains, in the United States, working capital and net worth, each in amounts equal to or greater than the total applicable amount, calculated as follows:
-</P>
-<P>(i) If the self-insurer has multiple vessels, calculate the total applicable amount based on the vessel with the greatest total applicable amount.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) In the case of a vessel greater than 300 gross tons, calculate the CERCLA applicable amount under § 138.100(b)(1) based on a vessel carrying hazardous substances as cargo.
-</P>
-<P>(e) <I>Reporting requirements for self-insurers and financial guarantors.</I> (1) Each self-insurer and financial guarantor must submit the following reports to the Director with the Application and annually thereafter, within the deadlines specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section:
-</P>
-<P>(i) Submit the self-insurer or financial guarantor's annual, current, and audited non-consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and audited by an independent Certified Public Accountant in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Accompany the financial statements with a declaration from the self-insurer or financial guarantor's chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official, certifying the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets, and the amount of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total assets included in the accompanying balance sheet, which are located in the United States.
-</P>
-<P>(iii) If the financial statements cannot be submitted in non-consolidated form, submit a consolidated statement accompanied by an additional declaration prepared by the same Certified Public Accountant - 
-</P>
-<P>(A) Verifying the amount by which the total assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) liabilities, and the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current assets located in the United States exceed the self-insurer or financial guarantor's total (worldwide) current liabilities;
-</P>
-<P>(B) Specifically naming the self-insurer or financial guarantor;
-</P>
-<P>(C) Confirming that the amounts so verified relate only to the self-insurer or financial guarantor, apart from any parent or other affiliated entity; and
-</P>
-<P>(D) Identifying the consolidated financial statement to which it applies.
-</P>
-<P>(2) When the self-insurer or financial guarantor's demonstrated net worth is not at least ten times the cumulative total applicable amounts, their chief financial officer, treasurer, or equivalent official must submit to the Director with the Application and semi-annually thereafter, within the deadline specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, an affidavit stating that neither their working capital nor net worth fell during the first 6 months of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's current fiscal year, below the cumulative total applicable amounts.
-</P>
-<P>(3) All self-insurers and financial guarantors must - 
-</P>
-<P>(i) Submit, upon the Director's request, additional financial information within the time specified; and
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Notify the Director in writing within 5 days following the date the self-insurer or financial guarantor knows, or has reason to know, that its working capital or net worth has fallen below the total applicable amounts.
-</P>
-<P>(4) All required annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 90 days after the close of the self-insurer or financial guarantor's fiscal year. All required semi-annual financial statements and declarations must be submitted to the Director within 30 days after the close of the applicable 6-month period. The Director will grant an extension of the time limits for submissions under this paragraph only as provided in § 138.60(e).
-</P>
-<P>(5) A failure by a self-insurer or financial guarantor to timely submit to the Director any statement, data, notification, or other submission required may result in the Director denying or revoking the COFR, and may prompt enforcement action as provided under § 138.170.
-</P>
-<P>(6) The Director may waive the working capital requirement for any self-insurer or financial guarantor that - 
-</P>
-<P>(i) Is a regulated public utility, a municipal or higher-level governmental entity, or an entity operating solely as a charitable, non-profit organization qualifying under the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)), provided that the self-insurer or financial guarantor demonstrates in writing that the waiver would benefit a local public interest; or
-</P>
-<P>(ii) Demonstrates in writing that working capital is not a significant factor in the self-insurer or financial guarantor's financial condition, in which case the self-insurer or financial guarantor's net worth in relation to the required cumulative total applicable amounts, and a history of stable operations, are the major elements considered by the Director.
-</P>
-<P>(f) <I>Other guaranty methods for establishing evidence of financial responsibility.</I> (1) The COFR Operator may request that the Director accept a guaranty method for establishing evidence of financial responsibility that is different from one of the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section as follows:
-</P>
-<P>(i) The COFR Operator must submit the request to the Director in writing, at least 90 days prior to the date the COFR is required.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) The request must describe in detail: The method proposed; the reasons why the COFR Operator does not wish to (or is unable to) use one of the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section; and how the proposed guaranty method assures that the vessel's responsible parties have the financial ability to meet their potential liabilities under OPA 90 and CERCLA in the event of an incident or a release.
-</P>
-<P>(iii) Each COFR Operator making a request under this paragraph must provide the Director a proposed guaranty form that includes all the elements described in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(2) The Director will not accept a self-insurance method other than the one described in paragraph (d) of this section. The Director also will not accept a guaranty method under this paragraph that merely deletes or alters a requirement or provision of one of the guaranty methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section (for example, one that alters the termination clause of the Insurance Guaranty).
-</P>
-<P>(3) A Director's decision to accept an alternative guaranty method of establishing evidence of financial responsibility under this paragraph is final agency action.
-</P>
-<P>(g) <I>Additional rules regarding multiple guarantors.</I> If more than one guarantor executes the relevant guaranty form, the following rules apply:
-</P>
-<P>(1) If a guarantor's percentage of vertical participation is specified on the relevant guaranty form, the guarantor is subject to direct action and is liable for the payment of costs and damages under OPA 90 or CERCLA, as applicable, only in accordance with the percentage of vertical participation so specified for that guarantor.
-</P>
-<P>(2) Participation in the form of layering (tiers, one in excess of another) is not permitted. Only vertical participation on a percentage basis and participation with no specified percentage allocation is acceptable.
-</P>
-<P>(3) If no percentage of vertical participation is specified for a guarantor on the relevant guaranty form, the guarantor's liability is joint and several for the total of the unspecified portion.
-</P>
-<P>(4) The participating guarantors must designate a lead guarantor having authority to bind all of the participating guarantors for actions required of guarantors under OPA 90 or CERCLA and this subpart, including but not limited to reporting changes in the evidence of financial responsibility as provided in § 138.150(d), receipt of source designations, advertisement of source designations and the responsible party's claims procedures, and receipt and settlement of claims.
-</P>
-<P>(h) <I>Direct action.</I> (1) Each guarantor providing evidence of financial responsibility must submit to the Director a written acknowledgment by the guarantor that a claimant (including a claimant by right of subrogation) may assert any claim for costs or damages arising under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, directly against the guarantor, regardless of whether the claim is asserted in an action in court or other proceeding. The guarantor must also acknowledge that, in the event a claim is asserted directly against the guarantor under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, the guarantor may invoke only the following rights and defenses - 
-</P>
-<P>(i) The incident, release, or both, were caused by the willful misconduct of a responsible party for whom the guaranty was provided;
-</P>
-<P>(ii) All rights and defenses, which would be available to the responsible party under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both, as applicable;
-</P>
-<P>(iii) A defense that the amount of the claim, or all claims asserted with respect to the same incident or release, whether asserted in court or in any other proceeding, exceeds the amount of the guaranty, except when the guaranty is based on the gross tonnage of the vessel (instead of the statutory minimums) and the guarantor knew or should have known that the applicable tonnage certificate was incorrect (see § 138.50(f)); and
-</P>
-<P>(iv) The claim is not one made under OPA 90, CERCLA, or both.
-</P>
-<P>(2) Except when the guaranty is based on the gross tonnage of the vessel (instead of the statutory minimums) and the guarantor knew or should have known that the evidence of financial responsibility or applicable tonnage certificate is incorrect (see § 138.50(f)), a guarantor who provides evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart will be liable, with respect to any one incident or release, or both, as applicable, only for the amount of costs and damages specified in the evidence of financial responsibility.
-</P>
-<P>(3) A guarantor will not be considered to have consented to direct action under any law other than OPA 90 or CERCLA, or to unlimited liability under any law or in any venue, solely because the guarantor has provided evidence of financial responsibility under this subpart.
-</P>
-<P>(4) In the event of any finding that the liability of a guarantor under OPA 90 or CERCLA exceeds the amount of the guaranty provided under this subpart, that guaranty is considered null and void with respect to that excess.
-</P>
-<P>(i) <I>Process upon disapproval of guarantor.</I> If the Director intends to disapprove or revoke the approval of a guarantor (for example, due to the guarantor's change in financial position), the Director will notify the COFR Operator of the need to establish new evidence of financial responsibility within a specified period.
-</P>
-<P>(1) If the COFR Operator establishes, or causes to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Application if otherwise complete will be approved or the COFR will remain in effect, and the COFR Operator will not have to pay a new Application fee or certification fee.
-</P>
-<P>(2) If the COFR Operator fails to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director in the notice, the Director may deny or revoke the COFR and, if revoked, the COFR Operator will have to apply for a new COFR and pay a new certification fee. The COFR Operator's failure to establish, or cause to be established, new acceptable evidence of financial responsibility within the period specified by the Director may also result in enforcement as provided under § 138.170.
