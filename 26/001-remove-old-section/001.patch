-<P>(h) <I>Substantial equivalence test</I> - (1) <I>In general.</I> The substantial equivalence test described in this paragraph (h) applies to determine whether a complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction. The substantial equivalence test assesses whether a complex contract substantially replicates the economic performance of the underlying security by comparing, at various testing prices for the underlying security, the differences between the expected changes in value of that complex contract and its initial hedge with the differences between the expected changes in value of a simple contract benchmark (as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) and its initial hedge. If the complex contract contains more than one reference to a single underlying security, all references to that underlying security are taken into account for purposes of applying the substantial equivalence test with respect to that underlying security. With respect to an equity derivative that is embedded in a debt instrument or other derivative, the substantial equivalence test is applied to the complex contract without taking into account changes in the market value of the debt instrument or other derivative that are not directly related to the equity element of the instrument. The complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security if, for that underlying security, the expected change in value of the complex contract and its initial hedge is equal to or less than the expected change in value of the simple contract benchmark and its initial hedge when the substantial equivalence test described in this paragraph (h) is calculated at the time the complex contract is issued. To the extent that the steps of the substantial equivalence test set out in this paragraph (h) cannot be applied to a particular complex contract, a taxpayer must use the principles of the substantial equivalence test to reasonably determine whether the complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction with respect to each underlying security. For purposes of this section, the test must be applied and the inputs must be determined in a commercially reasonable manner. If a taxpayer calculates any relevant input for non-tax business purposes, that input ordinarily is the input used for purposes of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Simple contract benchmark.</I> The simple contract benchmark is a closely comparable simple contract that, at the time the complex contract is issued, has a delta of 0.8, references the applicable underlying security referenced by the complex contract, and has the same maturity as the complex contract with respect to the applicable underlying security. Depending on the complex contract, the simple contract benchmark might be, for example, a call option, a put option, or a collar.
-</P>
-<P>(3) <I>Substantial equivalence.</I> A complex contract is a section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security if the complex contract calculation described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section results in an amount that is equal to or less than the amount of the benchmark calculation described in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(4) <I>Complex contract calculation</I> - (i) <I>In general.</I> The complex contract calculation for each underlying security referenced by a potential section 871(m) transaction that is a complex contract is computed by:
-</P>
-<P>(A) Determining the change in value (as described in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section) of the complex contract with respect to the underlying security at each testing price (as described in paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section);
-</P>
-<P>(B) Determining the change in value of the initial hedge for the complex contract at each testing price;
-</P>
-<P>(C) Determining the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the complex contract determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(A) of this section and the change in value of the initial hedge determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section at each testing price;
-</P>
-<P>(D) Determining the probability (as described in paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section) associated with each testing price;
-</P>
-<P>(E) Multiplying the absolute value for each testing price determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(C) of this section by the corresponding probability for that testing price determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(D) of this section;
-</P>
-<P>(F) Adding the product of each calculation determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(E) of this section; and
-</P>
-<P>(G) Dividing the sum determined in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(F) of this section by the initial hedge for the complex contract.
-</P>
-<P>(ii) <I>Determining the change in value.</I> The change in value of a complex contract is the difference between the value of the complex contract with respect to the underlying security at the time the complex contract is issued and the value of the complex contract with respect to the underlying security if the price of the underlying security were equal to the testing price at the time the complex contract is issued. The change in value of the initial hedge of a complex contract with respect to the underlying security is the difference between the value of the initial hedge at the time the complex contract is issued and the value of the initial hedge if the price of the underlying security were equal to the testing price at the time the complex contract is issued.
-</P>
-<P>(iii) <I>Testing price.</I> The testing prices must include the prices of the underlying security if the price of the underlying security at the time the complex contract is issued were alternatively increased by one standard deviation and decreased by one standard deviation, each of which is a separate testing price. In circumstances where using only two testing prices is reasonably likely to provide an inaccurate measure of substantial equivalence, a taxpayer must use additional testing prices as necessary to determine whether a complex contract satisfies the substantial equivalence test. If additional testing prices are used for the substantial equivalence test, the probabilities as described in paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section must be adjusted accordingly.
-</P>
-<P>(iv) <I>Probability.</I> For purposes of paragraphs (h)(4)(i)(D) and (E) of this section, the probability of an increase by one standard deviation is the measure of the likelihood that the price of the underlying security will increase by any amount from its price at the time the complex contract is issued. For purposes of paragraphs (h)(4)(i)(D) and (E) of this section, the probability of a decrease by one standard deviation is the measure of the likelihood that the price of the underlying security will decrease by any amount from its price at the time the complex contract is issued.
-</P>
-<P>(5) <I>Benchmark calculation.</I> The benchmark calculation with respect to each underlying security referenced by the potential section 871(m) transaction is determined by using the computation methodology described in paragraph (h)(4) of this section with respect to a simple contract benchmark for the underlying security.
-</P>
-<P>(6) <I>Substantial equivalence calculation for certain complex contracts that reference multiple underlying securities.</I> If a complex contract references 10 or more underlying securities and the short party uses an exchange-traded security (for example, an exchange-traded fund) that references substantially all of the underlying securities (the hedge security) to hedge the complex contract at the time it is issued, the substantial equivalence calculations for the complex contract may be calculated by treating the hedge security as the underlying security. When the hedge security is used for the substantial equivalence calculation pursuant to this paragraph (h)(6), the initial hedge is the number of shares of the hedge security for purposes of calculating the amount of a dividend equivalent as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section.
-</P>
-<P>(7) <I>Example.</I> The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (h) of this section. For purposes of this example, Stock X is common stock of domestic corporation X. FI is the financial institution that structures the transaction described in the example, and is the short party to the transaction. Investor is a nonresident alien individual.
-</P>
-<EXAMPLE>
-<HED>Example.</HED><PSPACE>Complex contract that is not substantially equivalent. (i) FI issues an investment contract (the Contract) that has a stated maturity of one year, and Investor purchases the Contract from FI at issuance for $10,000. At maturity, the Contract entitles Investor to a return of $10,000 (i) plus 200 percent of any appreciation in Stock X above $100 per share, capped at $110, on 100 shares or (ii) minus 100 percent of any depreciation in Stock X below $90 on 100 shares. At the time FI issues the Contract, the price of Stock X is $100 per share. Thus, for example, Investor will receive $11,000 if the price of Stock X is $105 per share at maturity of the Contract, but Investor will receive $9,000 if the price of Stock X is $80 per share when the Contract matures. At issuance, FI acquires 64 shares of Stock X to fully hedge the Contract issued to Investor.
-</PSPACE><P>(ii) The Contract references an underlying security and is not an NPC, so it is classified as an ELI under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. At issuance, the Contract does not provide for an amount paid at maturity that is calculated by reference to a single, fixed number of shares of Stock X. When the Contract matures, the amount paid is effectively calculated based on either 200 shares of Stock X (if the price of Stock X has appreciated up to $110) or 100 shares of Stock X (if the price of Stock X has declined below $90). Consequently, the Contract is a complex contract described in paragraph (a)(14) of this section.
-</P><P>(iii) Because it is a complex ELI, FI applies the substantial equivalence test described in paragraph (h) of this section to determine whether the Contract is a specified ELI. FI determines that the price of Stock X would be $120 if the price of Stock X were increased by one standard deviation, and $79 if the price of Stock X were decreased by one standard deviation. Based on these results, FI next determines the change in value of the Contract to be $2,000 at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation ($12,000 testing price minus $10,000 issue price) and a negative $1,100 at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation ($10,000 issue price minus $8,900 testing price). FI performs the same calculations for the 64 shares of Stock X that constitute the initial hedge, determining that the change in value of the initial hedge is $1,280 at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation ($6,400 at issuance compared to $7,680 at the testing price) and negative $1,344 at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation ($6,400 at issuance compared to $5,056 at the testing price).
-</P><P>(iv) FI then determines the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the Contract at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation and a decrease by one standard deviation. Increased by one standard deviation, the absolute value of the difference is $720 ($2,000 − $1,280); decreased by one standard deviation, the absolute value of the difference is $244 (negative $1,100 minus negative $1,344). FI determines that there is a 52% chance that the price of Stock X will have increased in value when the Contract matures and a 48% chance that the price of Stock X will have decreased in value at that time. FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the Contract at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation by 52%, which equals $374.40. FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the Contract at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation by 48%, which equals $117.12. FI adds these two numbers and divides by the number of shares that constitute the initial hedge to determine that the complex contract calculation is 7.68 ((374.40 plus 117.12) divided by 64).
-</P><P>(v) FI then performs the same calculation with respect to the simple contract benchmark, which is a one-year call option that references one share of Stock X, settles on the same date as the Contract, and has a delta of 0.8. The one-year call option has a strike price of $79 and has a cost (the purchase premium) of $22. The initial hedge for the one-year call option is 0.8 shares of Stock X.
-</P><P>(vi) FI first determines that the change in value of the simple contract benchmark is $19.05 if the testing price is increased by one standard deviation ($22.00 at issuance to $41.05 at the testing price) and negative $20.95 if the testing price is decreased by one standard deviation ($22.00 at issuance to $1.05 at the testing price). Second, FI determines that the change in value of the initial hedge is $16.00 at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation ($80 at issuance to $96 at the testing price) and negative $16.80 at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation ($80.00 at issuance to $63.20 at the testing price).
-</P><P>(vii) FI determines the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the one-year call option at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation is $3.05 ($16.00 minus $19.05). FI next determines the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the option at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation is $4.15 (negative $16.80 minus negative $20.95). FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the option at the testing price that represents an increase by one standard deviation by 52%, which equals $1.586. FI multiplies the absolute value of the difference between the change in value of the initial hedge and the option at the testing price that represents a decrease by one standard deviation by 48%, which equals $1.992. FI adds these two numbers and divides by the number of shares that constitute the initial hedge to determine that the benchmark calculation is 4.473 ((1.586 plus 1.992) divided by .8).
-</P><P>(viii) FI concludes that the Contract is not a section 871(m) transaction because the complex contract calculation of 7.68 exceeds the benchmark calculation of 4.473.</P></EXAMPLE>

-<P>(q) <I>Dividend and dividend equivalent payments to a qualified derivatives dealer</I> - (1) <I>In general.</I> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (q), a qualified derivatives dealer described in § 1.1441-1(e)(6) that receives a dividend or the payment of a dividend equivalent (within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section) in its dealer capacity will not be liable for tax under section 871 or section 881 provided that the qualified derivatives dealer complies with its obligations under the qualified intermediary agreement described in §§ 1.1441-1(e)(5) and 1.1441-1(e)(6). If a qualified derivatives dealer receives a dividend or dividend equivalent payment on or determined by reference to an underlying security and the offsetting dividend equivalent payment the qualified derivatives dealer is contractually obligated to make on the same underlying security is less than the dividend and dividend equivalent amount received (including when the qualified derivatives dealer is not contractually obligated to make an offsetting dividend equivalent payment), the qualified derivatives dealer is liable for tax under section 871 or section 881 for the difference. For purposes of this paragraph (q), a dividend or dividend equivalent is not treated as received by a qualified derivatives dealer acting in its dealer capacity if the dividend or dividend equivalent is received by the qualified derivatives dealer acting as a proprietary trader. Transactions properly reflected in a qualified derivatives dealer's dealer book are presumed to be held by a dealer in its dealer capacity for purposes of this paragraph (q).
-</P>
-<P>(2) <I>Examples.</I> The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (q):
-</P>
-<EXAMPLE>
-<HED>Example 1.</HED><PSPACE>Forward contract entered into by a foreign dealer. (i) <I>Facts.</I> FB is a foreign bank that is a qualified intermediary that acts as a qualified derivatives dealer. On April 1, Year 1, FB enters into a cash settled forward contract initiated by a foreign customer (Customer) that entitles Customer to receive from FB all of the appreciation and dividends on 100 shares of Stock X, and obligates Customer to pay FB any depreciation on 100 shares of Stock X, at the end of three years. FB hedges the forward contract by entering into a total return swap contract with a domestic broker (U.S. Broker) and maintains the swap contract as a hedge for the duration of the forward contract. The swap contract entitles FB to receive an amount equal to all of the dividends on 100 shares of Stock X and obligates FB to pay an amount referenced to a floating interest rate each quarter, and also entitles FB to receive from or pay to U.S. Broker, as the case may be, the difference between the value of 100 shares of Stock X at the inception of the swap and the value of 100 shares of Stock X at the end of 3 years. FB provides valid documentation to U.S. Broker that FB will receive payments under the swap contract in its capacity as a qualified derivatives dealer, and FB contemporaneously enters both the swap contract with U.S. Broker and the forward contract with Customer on its dealer books. Stock X pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share.
-</PSPACE><P>(ii) <I>Application of rules.</I> FB is a long party on a delta one contract (the total return swap) and a short party on a delta one contract (the forward contract with Customer). U.S. Broker is not obligated to withhold on the dividend equivalent payments to FB on the swap contract that are referenced to Stock X dividends, however, because U.S. Broker has received valid documentation that it may rely upon to treat the payment as made to FB acting as a qualified derivatives dealer. Similarly, FB is not obligated to pay tax on the payments it receives from U.S. Broker referenced to Stock X dividends because at the time it received the payments FB was contractually obligated to make fully offsetting dividend equivalent payments as the short party with respect to 100 shares of Stock X to Customer. FB is required to withhold on dividend equivalent payments to Customer on the forward contract in accordance with § 1.1441-2(e)(8).</P></EXAMPLE>
-<EXAMPLE>
-<HED>Example 2.</HED><PSPACE><I>At-the-money option contract entered into by a foreign dealer.</I> (i) <I>Facts.</I> The facts are the same as Example 1, but customer purchases from FB an at-the-money call option on 100 shares of Stock X with a term of one year. The call option has a delta of 0.5 and FB hedges the call option by purchasing 50 shares of Stock X, which are held in an account with U.S. Broker, who also acts as paying agent.
-</PSPACE><P>(ii) <I>Application of rules.</I> FB is a long party on 50 shares of Stock X and a short party on an option. Because the option has a delta of less than 0.8 on the date it was issued, it is not a section 871(m) transaction. U.S. Broker is not obligated to withhold on the Stock X dividends paid to FB because U.S. Broker has received valid documentation that it may rely upon to treat the dividends as paid to FB acting as a qualified derivatives dealer. FB is liable for tax under section 871 or section 881 on the Stock X dividends it receives from U.S. Broker, however, because at the time it received the dividends FB was not contractually obligated to make an offsetting dividend equivalent payment to Customer. FB is not required to make an offsetting dividend equivalent payment to Customer because the option has a delta of 0.5; therefore, it is not a section 871(m) transaction.</P></EXAMPLE>
-<EXAMPLE>
-<HED>Example 3.</HED><PSPACE><I>In-the-money option contract entered into by a foreign dealer.</I> (i) <I>Facts.</I> The facts are the same as Example 2, but Customer purchases from FB an in-the-money call option on 100 shares of Stock X with a term of one year. The call option has a delta of 0.8 and FB hedges the call option by purchasing 80 shares of Stock X, which are held in an account with U.S. Broker, who also acts as paying agent. The price of Stock X declines substantially and the option lapses unexercised.
-</PSPACE><P>(ii) <I>Application of rules.</I> FB is a long party on 80 shares of Stock X and a short party on an option. Because the option has a delta of 0.8 on the date it was issued, it is a section 871(m) transaction. U.S. Broker is not obligated to withhold on the Stock X dividends paid to FB because U.S. Broker has received valid documentation that it may rely upon to treat the dividends as paid to FB acting as a qualified derivatives dealer. Similarly, FB is not obligated to pay tax on the Stock X dividends it receives from U.S. Broker to the extent that FB is contractually obligated to make offsetting dividend equivalent payments as the short party to Customer. FB is required to withhold on dividend equivalent payments to Customer on the option contract in accordance with § 1.1441-2(e)(8). FB is also liable for tax under section 871 or section 881 on Stock X dividends, if any, that exceed the dividend equivalent payment to Customer.</P></EXAMPLE>
