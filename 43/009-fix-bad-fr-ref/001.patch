 <P>(e) If the successful bidder's eligibility for a variable offset cannot be verified until a later time, the BLM may require the successful bidder to submit the full bid amount, without taking into account the variable offset, and hold the amount of the variable offset in suspense. The amount of the bonus bid corresponding to the variable offset will be refunded or credited to the successful bidder once the successful bidder has demonstrated that it has qualified for the variable offset. The BLM may set a deadline in the notice of competitive process by which the successful bidder must demonstrate its qualifications.
